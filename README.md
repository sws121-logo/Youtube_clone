# Video Streaming Application

## Overview

The Video Streaming Application is a modern web application built with React and Material-UI that allows users to search for videos, view detailed information about specific videos, and explore channels. This application leverages the RapidAPI service to fetch video data from various sources, providing users with a seamless experience in discovering and watching videos.
