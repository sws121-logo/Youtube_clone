# Video Streaming Application

## Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly video streaming platform where users can easily search, browse, and watch video content. This project demonstrates how to build a modern web application using React and Material-UI, incorporating dynamic API calls to retrieve data, and providing a responsive user interface. 

The project also serves as a practical example of integrating third-party APIs into a React application and handling various React concepts like routing, component reusability, and state management. This could be a foundation for larger-scale video streaming platforms or any content delivery web apps.

### Key Objectives:
- **Demonstrating React capabilities**: Showcasing how React, with libraries like React Router and Material-UI, can be used to build dynamic, modular applications.
- **API Integration**: Display how to fetch and display data from external APIs in real-time.
- **User Experience**: Build a sleek, modern interface that allows users to interact seamlessly with video content.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure that the application works well across devices, utilizing Material-UI’s responsive components.

## What the Project Does

This project allows users to:
1. **Browse a Feed of Videos**: The homepage displays a feed of videos pulled dynamically from an API.
2. **Search for Videos**: Users can type a search term to find specific videos related to that term.
3. **View Detailed Video Information**: Each video has a dedicated detail page that shows video metadata, title, description, and possibly other related videos.
4. **Explore Channel Details**: Users can click on a video creator’s name to see more information about their channel, including other videos they’ve posted.
5. **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts smoothly for mobile, tablet, and desktop users, making it accessible on a range of devices.

## Features

- **Home Feed**: A dynamic list of trending or recent videos.
- **Search**: A robust search feature that allows users to find videos by typing a keyword.
- **Video Details**: A separate page for each video with detailed information and related content.
- **Channel Details**: An overview of video creators, allowing users to browse content by a specific creator or channel.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: A responsive layout that works across different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

The application leverages the following technologies:

- **React**: JavaScript library used for building the user interface and handling component-based architecture.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different views (Home, Video Detail, Channel Detail, etc.).
- **Material-UI**: A popular UI framework for React that provides customizable and responsive components.
- **API**: The project interacts with a video-related API (RapidAPI) to fetch and display video data dynamically.
- **Node.js** and **npm**: Used for dependency management and running the application.

## Installation Guide

To run this project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**: 

   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sws121-logo/video-streaming-app.git
   cd video-streaming-app
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   Once inside the project directory, install the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up API Key**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key for accessing video content via RapidAPI:
   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   Start the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Project Structure

```plaintext

├── components/          # Contains individual React components like Navbar, Feed, VideoDetail, etc.
├── App.js               # The main App component where routing is set up.
├── index.js             # The entry point of the application.
├── styles/              # Custom styles and theme configurations.
├── services/            # Contains API calls and data fetching logic.
.env                     # Environment variables (e.g., API keys).
```

### Core Components

- **Navbar**: Top navigation bar with a search input.
- **Feed**: The main feed that displays a list of videos.
- **VideoDetail**: Page that shows detailed information about a single video.
- **ChannelDetail**: Page displaying a video creator's channel and other related videos.
- **SearchFeed**: Displays search results for videos based on user input.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:
- **Browse videos**: The home page will display a list of trending or recent videos.
- **Search for videos**: Use the search bar in the navbar to search for specific video content.
- **Click on videos**: Select any video to view more details and watch the content.
- **Explore channels**: Click on the creator’s name to visit their channel and browse through their other videos.

## API Integration

The application integrates with an external API (RapidAPI) to fetch video data. You will need an API key to access this functionality. The API key is stored in the `.env` file for secure access during development.

Ensure your `.env` file includes:
```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
```

## Future Improvements

Some potential future improvements include:
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and personalize their video feed.
- **Comment Section**: Add functionality for users to view and add comments to videos.
- **Like/Dislike Feature**: Enable users to rate videos.
- **Video Upload Feature**: Allow users to upload their own videos to the platform.
